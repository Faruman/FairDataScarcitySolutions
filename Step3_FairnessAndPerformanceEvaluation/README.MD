# Step 3: Fairness and Performance Evaluation
Finally, the data scarcity solution archetypes were assessed for fairness and performance using the LendingClub dataset in conjunction with US census data.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8

### Installing

* After downloading the repository, install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal:
``` 
pip install requirements -r requirements.txt
```

## Downloading Data
To have the necessary data for the empirical evaluation it needs to be downloaded from the following sources:

* **Census:** https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT5Y2022.B02001?g=010XX00US$8600000 > ./data/raw/census
* **Economy:** https://data.worldbank.org/country/US > ./data/raw/economy
* **Housing:** https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx > ./data/raw/housing
* **Lending Club:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club > ./data/raw/lendingClub

## Performing Preprocessing
To combine the multiple data sources neede for our evaluation the ./data/preprocessing.py script needs to get executed.

## Running Data Scarcity Solutions
To get the results for each individual DSS as well as the baseline the corresponding files ({DSS}.py) need to be run.

## Analysing Results
After all individual DSS scripts have been completed successfully the final comparison can be generated by running the main.py file.
